    "**Q1.** Please answer the following questions in your own words.\n",
    "1. Why is the Gini a good loss function for categorical target variables? \n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is a clear and intuitive measure of how much that data is split into each class of the categorical target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do trees tend to overfit, and how can this tendency be constrained? \n",
    "\n",
    "Trees tend to overfit because they learn the training set too well as they build a complex and deep decision tree, so they capture noise or random fluctuations in the training data, rather than learning the underlying patterns that generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "To constrain the tendency of overfitting, we could truncate the tree and limit its depth, so that it isn't making splits on very fine distinctions among a handful of observations. Also, we could impose a lower bound on the impurity that can appear at a terminal node (don't allow the terminal nodes to be \"too pure\"), or we could impose a limit on how few cases can appear at a terminal node (don't allow the terminal nodes to be \"too small\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. True or false, and explain: Trees only really perform well in situations with lots of categorical variables as features/covariates. \n",
    "\n",
    "False. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical variables effectively and they are good at capturing non-linear relationships for the continuous variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why don't most versions of classification/regression tree concept allow for more than two branches after a split?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because when we are choosing the sub-nodes, we are choosing the one that minimizes the impurity of the resulting subsets, so that we constrain the tendency of overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. What are some heuristic ways you can examine a tree and decide whether it is probably over- or under-fitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "We could split the sample dataset into training data and testing data, and then use the testing data to find out how the model perform and see if it is over- or under-fitting. Also, we could calculate the accuracy based on the confusion matrix to determine the performance, or carefully stop to avoid overfitting, "
